Projects

A small and nice sample of my projects

##### Project 1 – Friend query #####
This project allows you to fitter a list of friends you want to see on the left side of the page by entering first name, last name of both of them (parts of name also will work, the images comes from Facebook). 
After that you can drag and drop the person to the central box and see\edit his details (I want to note that not all users have all of the details).  At the moment you change person's detail it automatically saves it on your Local Storage of the browser. 

** Project 2 – Quiz **
This project allows you test your mathematical skills (). You can choose an exam from the list, solve it and get a feedback for your success. All the data come from JSON files.

** Project 3 – Leader board **
This project is just a one language\variant of a big leader board system of a Rummy Facebook game (https://apps.facebook.com/rummyrush). In my sample you can see the English version of one of the leader boards. All players data comes from a JSON configuration file that allows to change designs by changing the Sprite image of each version\language.

** Project 4 – Casino page **
Link to the page: http://www.rummyroyal.com/casino_games
Link to JS file: http://www.rummyroyal.com/common_shared/javascript/casino_games.js 
This is a casino page with a nice gallery and a jackpot counting mechanism that starts counting on every page reload with random value from 3 million to 6 million.
